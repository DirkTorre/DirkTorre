Hello, Iâ€™m Dirk (32),

I am, and always have been, interested in discovering how (and why) things function. My main subjects for this are computers and living creatures (organisms). Watching Jurassic Park as a kid could probably be the source of this interest. This developed into a fascination with research, science, genomics, and programming. So, enrolling in a Bioinformatics program was inevitable.

At its core, I have a strong passion for collecting and organizing data so that my fellow fanatics and I can discover insights into how and why thing's function like they do. To facilitate this curiosity, I commit myself to continuous learning and creating and focus on enhancing my Software Engineering and Bioinformatics skills. The best way to do this is by starting a project that intersects with my interests.

**Degree**: BSc. Bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden.

## Technical interests
- Software Engineering (Python, R, Linux, SQL)

- Studied on the job: JavaScript, Google Sheets API
- Gained more experience: Data Wrangling
  
2019 feb - 2020 feb | **Immunetune** | Software Engineer / Bioinformatics Researcher | Solo Graduation Internship Project

- Proved that a DNA-vaccin design didn't need DNA spacers between antigens to stop the occurence of junction epitopes,
by creating a program that optimises the order of chained antigens using an pathfinding algorithm.
This insight helps researchers design a more effecive DNA vaccine to combat skin cancer recurrence.
- Studied on the job: Django web development, Cancer Research, Vaccin Development
- Gained more experience: Python, Pandas, Databases, Immunology

<!-- Optimalisation of a DNA-vaccine. Graduation internship. Development of software that helped minimize the juncture epitopes of a DNA vaccine for a mouse melanoma model. The project ended in development phase in 2020. In early 2020 the project was restarted to produce a working GUI on a desktop to help ImmuneTune enhance an experimental corona vaccine. (Python, Pandas, Django, Linux) -->

2016 sep - 2017 jan | **Naturalis Biodiversity Center** | Software Engineer | Group Internship Project

Hello, Iâ€™m Dirk (32), 

I am passionate about data collection and analysis, possess strong problem-solving abilities, and am highly creative. Committed to continuous learning, I focus on enhancing my software engineering and bioinformatics skills. 

Degree: BSc. Bioinformatics at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. 

Technical interests: 
- Software Engineering (Python, R, Linux, SQL) 
- Data Science 
- Bioinformatics (Informatics and Biology) 
- Life Science and Technology 
- Web Development 

##  Finished professional projects
- 2023 jan - 2023 feb | **Tectum Services Corp** | Decreased labor intensity of cleaning and summarising appointment data by developing a plug-in for Google Sheets in JavaScript, leading to insights into network engineering obstacles and team performance. Studied Javascript and Google Sheets API on the job.
  
- 2019 feb - 2020 feb | **Immunetune** | Learning on the job | Optimalisation of a DNA-vaccine. Graduation internship. Development of software that helped minimize the juncture epitopes of a DNA vaccine for a mouse melanoma model. The project ended in development phase in 2020. In early 2020 the project was restarted to produce a working GUI on a desktop to help ImmuneTune enhance an experimental corona vaccine. (Python, Pandas, Django, Linux)

- 2016 - 2017 | **Naturalis Biodiversity Center** | Short optional internship as a group project. Extension of sequencing pipeline for pollen detection, so it could detect more allergens such as animal hairs. (Python, Bash Scripting for Linux)
