Hello, I’m Dirk (32),

I enjoy collecting and analyzing a variety of data.
I am autodidact Autodidact met een goed probleemoplossend vermogen en een hoge mate van creativiteit.
(always learning new things (and practising) related to software engineering and bioinformatics).

Degree: BSc. Bioinformatics at University of Applied Sciences Leiden.

Technical interests:
- Software Engineering (Python, R, Linux, SQL)
- Data Science
- Bioinformatics (Informatics and Biology)
- Life Science & Technology
- Web Development

# Rough calculation of years of experiences
This only contains time that I can prove that i was learning/working on the subjects, in reality it's more, because of overlapping experiences.

# Finished professional projects
## code not on Github:
- 2023 jan - 2023 feb | **Tectum Services Corp** | Learning on the job | Development of a Google Sheets plug-in for cleaning and summarizing data related to internet network technician appointments. (JavaScript)
- 2019 feb - 2020 feb | **Immunetune** | Learning on the job | Optimalisation of a DNA-vaccine. Graduation internship. Development of software that helped to minimize the juncture epitopes of a DNA vaccine for a mouse melanoma model. The project ended in development phase in 2020. In early 2020 the project was restarted to produce a working GUI on a desktop to help ImmuneTune enhance an experimental corona vaccine. (Python, Pandas, Django, Linux)
- 2016 - 2017 | **Naturalis Biodiversity Center** | Short optional internship as a group project. Extension of sequencing pipeline for pollen detection, so it could detect more allergens such as animal hairs. (Python, Bash Scripting for Linux)
